I recently moved out of my apartment in New York, and tried to get rid of everything last minute. Facebook Marketplace has always been good to me, but as of July 2023, it is completely <b>unusable</b> and littered with scammers.

In New York, goods are cheap and transportation is king. Everyone has stuff to get rid of, even <i>quality</i> stuff, but nobody wants to deal with the hassle of picking things up or hiring movers (movers can cost more than the fucking item).

I understood this about the market, so my goal was not really to recoup the cost of my furniture, but actually to get rid of stuff with the path of least resistance. I would have paid somebody to take my stuff away, and it turns out there are paid services that pick up furniture or <b>trash</b>, because <i>goods without shipping</i> can be deemed trash [^1].

I made a few honest postings - a $400 bed for $50, a $200 chair for $30, so naturally I didn't expect much resistance. I didn't list items for free because I had a bad experience before where people wouldn't take me seriously or blow me off. 

Even if you want to give something quality out for free, putting some blinds up makes others value it more. Skin-in-the-game. 

# The scam

### The pledge

I get a message from an interested buyer. He even asks legitimate questions, asks for original price sources, and might even ask for a discount.

### The turn

The buyer then claims he wants it, and bad, but he's unavailable (out-of-town, or other bullshit). But his wife/brother/milkman is in town! Would it be alright if he venmo'd me first?

My venmo account is still dry.


### The prestige

Venmo is acting up! It's on my side! I need to check my email and do something from venmo!

Things start to get a little fishy..

Note that I got <b>dozens</b> of these messages, and the first ones very quickly after I posted my listings. The legitimate buyers would not show up until a day later. I didn't end up selling or getting rid of a single item on marketplace.


#### Footnotes
[^1]: Andy got a $1200 sofa for $100. The owner listed it for $800, and Andy messaged him asking if he'd take $100. Andy was willing to get a U-haul, drive in the madness of the city, and <b>get his hands dirty.</b> Owner scoffed and said fuck no, this is top-shelf stuff. A month later, Andy picked up his sofa.
